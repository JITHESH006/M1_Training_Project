# Requirements
## Introduction
 This project entails the development of the " HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM," a programme designed to keep track of the number of patients admitted to the hospital. The application is extremely useful for quickly locating inpatient and outpatient results. In the hospital demo, you can search for doctors who are related to your patients. c is used to develop the project and its execution.

## Research

About Hospital Management System :

---Add new patient record. 
---Search or edit patient record.
---Delete patient records'

---Exit from the system
 
## Cost and Features and Timeline

1.Time-saving Technology
2.Improved Efficiency by avoiding human errors
3.Reduces scope for Error
4.Data security and correct data retrieval made possible
5.Cost effective and easily manageable
6.Easy access to patient data with correct patient history
7.Improved patient care made possible
8.Reduces the work of documentation

## Defining Our System
    In our project (Hospital management system), users can log in and enter their password, after which the main menu will appear. The default login password would be set.
The user can now create new patient records, delete current patient records, change existing records, and examine a list of existing records, among other things. Finally, the user can log out of the system.

## Who
The installation of a hospital management system project delivers a number of benefits to the institution, including increased service quality and efficiency. As previously stated, it is built so that a user can manage the following: patient information, records, and management, as well as third-parties such as medicine suppliers and insurance organisations.

## What
The hospital management system aids in the registration of complete patient data. It records and retains the patient's medical history, treatment needs, past visit details, planned appointments (if any), reports, insurance information, and more. It reduces the requirement for these details to be obtained at each visit.
## When
HMS information system helps to track and control finances, reduce leakages as well as reduce manual work and therefore there is no requirement of the higher human workforce.

## Where
The Hospital Management System enables healthcare workers to review clinical documentation, diagnoses, patient data, and other pertinent information in a single perspective, allowing them to make timely choices.
## How
    The system creates an external file to store the data perminantly.This system is deployed using c programming.
